# Realraum Window Demo

Responsive VGA based Demo for the Realraum Window front

## TL;DR
 * Detect people walking by through Radar Sensors (10 GHz)
 * Enable Screens only when so. is walking by to reduce power consumption
 * Use Raspberry Pi Pico(s) to run VGA based demos / intros
 * Maybe also use normal Raspberry Pi (1,2, etc.) to display other info
